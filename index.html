  <h2>Avatar: </h2>
    <p>The avatar that I choose is a laptop with some coding on the screen.
      My pasion is coding, I could say my preferred programing language is either C# and Java.<br>
      For example, If I were creating a database derived program, I will choose Java. <br>
      If the program could be developed without implementing a database, C## will be my best option.
