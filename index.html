  <h2> <a href="avatar.png"> My Avatar... </a>   </h2>
  <p>The avatar that I chose was a laptop with some coding on the screen.
    My pasion is coding, I could say my preferred programing language is either C# and Java.<br>
    For example, If I were creating a database derived program, I will choose Java. <br>
    If the program could be developed without implementing a database, C## will be my best option.
